# TUI 2048

## About

A 2048 game.

Primarily written for
- exercising cmake
- exercising c++
- fooling around with notcurses

## Build status

Before checking in, the program has to build and has to succeed all defined
tests.

## Introduction

## Installation

Well, hopefully ...
```
$ cmake
```

## Requirements

There have to be some libs installed:
- notcurses

## Getting Started

Well, start the program. The goal is to achieve the ominous 2048 tile. With
every move you can push the existing tiles up, down, left or right (cursor
keys). Whenever two tiles with the same number collide, they get added and one
vanishes.
